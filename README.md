# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
A real time bus tracker using data from MBTA for Bus Number 1 that travels between the MIT and Harvard campuses. It currently only shows the bus stops of Bus Number 1.

To run, either download all the files and open index.html in a web browser or visit https://kp-2.github.io/Real-Time-Bus-Tracker/.

## Roadmap of future improvements
1. Pull real time bus location data using the MBTA API and display the location on the map.
2. Expand the program to show locations for all MBTA busses.
